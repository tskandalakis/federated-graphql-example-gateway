# Federated-GraphQL-Example Gateway

## Tooling Setup
To get started, all you'll need to do is open a terminal and run:
```bash
$ npm install
* npm run start
```
Or if you are running locally the other graph services should be running locally first, then run:
```bash
$ npm install
* npm run start:local
```

This will pull all required dependencies, compile the typescript, and start the node server.

### Example npm commands
Run jest tests:
```bash
$ npm test
```
Run jest tests with coverage:
```bash
$ npm run coverage
```
